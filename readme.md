### GUI wrapper for Ventoy

![](https://i.imgur.com/qI6cQyF.png)

This is a simple GTK wrapper for [Ventoy](ventoy.net) making it's console interface into GTK python app.

Everything is as simple as pie. Just clone the repository with git or download source from release page. 
Unpack it and launch it with python 3. It will install needed python libraries if those are missing. 

#### Make sure you have pip3 installed!
Comes with 1.0.29 [Ventoy](ventoy.net). Pull requests are welcome!

## Plans for later:
- Make Ventoy updatable within GUI.
- Add support for more Ventoy features.
- Provide installation result after the install.
